When a node of type `query-id` is needed,\n *   the two functions can be used to create it.\n * \n *   The three arguments are:\n * \n *   - `query-id` - typically a namespaced keyword (later used in subscribe)\n *   - optionally, an `input signals` function which returns the input data\n *  flows required by this kind of node.\n *   - a `computation function` which computes the value (output) of the\n *  node (from the input data flows)\n * \n *   Later, during app execution, a call to `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 :blue])`,\n *   will trigger the need for a new `:sub-id` Signal Graph node (matching the\n *   query `[:sub-id 3 :blue]`). And, to create that node the two functions\n *   associated with `:sub-id` will be looked up and used.\n * \n *   Just to be clear: calling `reg-sub` does not immediately create a node.\n *   It only registers 'a mechanism' (the two functions) by which nodes\n *   can be created later, when a node is bought into existence by the\n *   use of `subscribe` in a `View Function`.\n * \n *   The `computation function` is expected to take two arguments:\n * \n *  - `input-values` - the values which flow into this node (how is it wierd into the graph?)\n *  - `query-vector` - the vector given to `subscribe`\n * \n *   and it returns a computed value (which then becomes the output of the node)\n * \n *   When `computation function` is called, the 2nd `query-vector` argument will be that\n *   vector supplied to the `subscribe`. So, if the call was `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 :blue])`,\n *   then the `query-vector` supplied to the computaton function will be `[:sub-id 3 :blue]`.\n * \n *   The argument(s) supplied to `reg-sub` between `query-id` and the `computation-function`\n *   can vary in 3 ways, but whatever is there defines the `input signals` part\n *   of `the mechanism`, specifying what input values \"flow into\" the\n *   `computation function` (as the 1st argument) when it is called.\n * \n *   So, `reg-sub` can be called in one of three ways, because there are three ways\n *   to define the input signals part. But note, the 2nd method, in which a\n *   `signals function` is explicitly supplied, is the most canonical and\n *   instructive. The other two are really just sugary variations.\n * \n *   **First variation** - no input signal function given:\n * \n *    #!clj\n *    (reg-sub\n *      :query-id\n *      a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n * \n *   In the absence of an explicit `signals function`, the node's input signal defaults to `app-db`\n *   and, as a result, the value within `app-db` (a map) is\n *   is given as the 1st argument when `a-computation-fn` is called.\n * \n * \n *   **Second variation** - a signal function is explicitly supplied:\n * \n *    #!clj\n *    (reg-sub\n *      :query-id\n *      signal-fn     ;; <-- here\n *      computation-fn)\n * \n *   This is the most canonical and instructive of the three variations.\n * \n *   When a node is created from the template, the `signal function` will be called and it\n *   is expected to return the input signal(s) as either a singleton, if there is only\n *   one, or a sequence if there are many, or a map with the signals as the values.\n * \n *   The current values of the returned signals will be supplied as the 1st argument to\n *   the `a-computation-fn` when it is called - and subject to what this `signal-fn` returns,\n *   this value will be either a singleton, sequence or map of them (paralleling\n *   the structure returned by the `signal function`).\n * \n *   This example `signal function` returns a 2-vector of input signals.\n * \n *    #!clj\n *    (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n *       [(subscribe [:a-sub])\n *        (subscribe [:b-sub])])\n * \n *   The associated computation function must be written\n *   to expect a 2-vector of values for its first argument:\n * \n *    #!clj\n *    (fn [[a b] query-vec]     ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\n *      ....)\n * \n *   If, on the other hand, the signal function was simpler and returned a singleton, like this:\n * \n *    #!clj\n *    (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n *      (subscribe [:a-sub]))      ;; <-- returning a singleton\n * \n *   then the associated computation function must be written to expect a single value\n *   as the 1st argument:\n * \n *    #!clj\n *    (fn [a query-vec]       ;; 1st argument is a single value\n *       ...)\n * \n *   Further Note: variation #1 above, in which an `input-fn` was not supplied, like this:\n * \n *    #!clj\n *    (reg-sub\n *      :query-id\n *      a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n * \n *   is the equivalent of using this\n *   2nd variation and explicitly suppling a `signal-fn` which returns `app-db`:\n * \n *    #!clj\n *    (reg-sub\n *      :query-id\n *      (fn [_ _]  re-frame/app-db)   ;; <--- explicit signal-fn\n *      a-computation-fn)             ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n * \n *   **Third variation** - syntax Sugar\n * \n *    #!clj\n *    (reg-sub\n *      :a-b-sub\n *      :<- [:a-sub]\n *      :<- [:b-sub]\n *      (fn [[a b] query-vec]    ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\n *        {:a a :b b}))\n * \n *   This 3rd variation is just syntactic sugar for the 2nd.  Instead of providing an\n *   `signals-fn` you provide one or more pairs of `:<-` and a subscription vector.\n * \n *   If you supply only one pair a singleton will be supplied to the computation function,\n *   as if you had supplied a `signal-fn` returning only a single value:\n * \n *    #!clj\n *    (reg-sub\n *      :a-sub\n *      :<- [:a-sub]\n *      (fn [a query-vec]      ;; only one pair, so 1st argument is a single value\n *        ...))\n * \n *   For further understanding, read the tutorials, and look at the detailed comments in\n *   /examples/todomvc/src/subs.cljs.\n * \n *   See also: `subscribe`\n *   \n */\nre_frame.core.reg_sub = (function re_frame$core$reg_sub(var_args){\nvar args__5775__auto__ = [];\nvar len__5769__auto___47552 = arguments.length;\nvar i__5770__auto___47553 = (0);\nwhile(true){\nif((i__5770__auto___47553 < len__5769__auto___47552)){\nargs__5775__auto__.push((arguments[i__5770__auto___47553]));\n\nvar G__47554 = (i__5770__auto___47553 + (1));\ni__5770__auto___47553 = G__47554;\ncontinue;\n} else {\n}\nbreak;\n}\n\nvar argseq__5776__auto__ = ((((1) < args__5775__auto__.length))?(new cljs.core.IndexedSeq(args__5775__auto__.slice((1)),(0),null)):null);\nreturn re_frame.core.reg_sub.cljs$core$IFn$_invoke$arity$variadic((arguments[(0)]),argseq__5776__auto__);\n});\n\n(re_frame.core.reg_sub.cljs$core$IFn$_invoke$arity$variadic = (function (query_id,args){\nreturn cljs.core.apply.cljs$core$IFn$_invoke$arity$2(re_frame.subs.reg_sub,cljs.core.into.cljs$core$IFn$_invoke$arity$2(new cljs.core.PersistentVector(null, 1, 5, cljs.core.PersistentVector.EMPTY_NODE, [query_id], null),args));\n}));\n\n(re_frame.core.reg_sub.cljs$lang$maxFixedArity = (1));\n\n/** @this {Function} */\n(re_frame.core.reg_sub.cljs$lang$applyTo = (function (seq47332){\nvar G__47333 = cljs.core.first(seq47332);\nvar seq47332__$1 = cljs.core.next(seq47332);\nvar self__5754__auto__ = this;\nreturn self__5754__auto__.cljs$core$IFn$_invoke$arity$variadic(G__47333,seq47332__$1);\n}));\n\n/**\n * Given a `query` vector, returns a Reagent `reaction` which will, over\n *   time, reactively deliver a stream of values.

When a node of type `query-id` is needed,\n  the two functions can be used to create it.\n\n  The three arguments are:\n\n  - `query-id` - typically a namespaced keyword (later used in subscribe)\n  - optionally, an `input signals` function which returns the input data\n    flows required by this kind of node.\n  - a `computation function` which computes the value (output) of the\n    node (from the input data flows)\n\n  Later, during app execution, a call to `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 :blue])`,\n  will trigger the need for a new `:sub-id` Signal Graph node (matching the\n  query `[:sub-id 3 :blue]`). And, to create that node the two functions\n  associated with `:sub-id` will be looked up and used.\n\n  Just to be clear: calling `reg-sub` does not immediately create a node.\n  It only registers 'a mechanism' (the two functions) by which nodes\n  can be created later, when a node is bought into existence by the\n  use of `subscribe` in a `View Function`.\n\n  The `computation function` is expected to take two arguments:\n\n    - `input-values` - the values which flow into this node (how is it wierd into the graph?)\n    - `query-vector` - the vector given to `subscribe`\n\n  and it returns a computed value (which then becomes the output of the node)\n\n  When `computation function` is called, the 2nd `query-vector` argument will be that\n  vector supplied to the `subscribe`. So, if the call was `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 :blue])`,\n  then the `query-vector` supplied to the computaton function will be `[:sub-id 3 :blue]`.\n\n  The argument(s) supplied to `reg-sub` between `query-id` and the `computation-function`\n  can vary in 3 ways, but whatever is there defines the `input signals` part\n  of `the mechanism`, specifying what input values \\\"flow into\\\" the\n  `computation function` (as the 1st argument) when it is called.\n\n  So, `reg-sub` can be called in one of three ways, because there are three ways\n  to define the input signals part. But note, the 2nd method, in which a\n  `signals function` is explicitly supplied, is the most canonical and\n  instructive. The other two are really just sugary variations.\n\n  **First variation** - no input signal function given:\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :query-id\n        a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n\n     In the absence of an explicit `signals function`, the node's input signal defaults to `app-db`\n     and, as a result, the value within `app-db` (a map) is\n     is given as the 1st argument when `a-computation-fn` is called.\n\n\n  **Second variation** - a signal function is explicitly supplied:\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :query-id\n        signal-fn     ;; <-- here\n        computation-fn)\n\n  This is the most canonical and instructive of the three variations.\n\n  When a node is created from the template, the `signal function` will be called and it\n  is expected to return the input signal(s) as either a singleton, if there is only\n  one, or a sequence if there are many, or a map with the signals as the values.\n\n  The current values of the returned signals will be supplied as the 1st argument to\n  the `a-computation-fn` when it is called - and subject to what this `signal-fn` returns,\n  this value will be either a singleton, sequence or map of them (paralleling\n  the structure returned by the `signal function`).\n\n  This example `signal function` returns a 2-vector of input signals.\n\n      #!clj\n      (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n         [(subscribe [:a-sub])\n          (subscribe [:b-sub])])\n\n  The associated computation function must be written\n  to expect a 2-vector of values for its first argument:\n\n      #!clj\n      (fn [[a b] query-vec]     ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\n        ....)\n\n  If, on the other hand, the signal function was simpler and returned a singleton, like this:\n\n      #!clj\n      (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n        (subscribe [:a-sub]))      ;; <-- returning a singleton\n\n  then the associated computation function must be written to expect a single value\n  as the 1st argument:\n\n      #!clj\n      (fn [a query-vec]       ;; 1st argument is a single value\n         ...)\n\n  Further Note: variation #1 above, in which an `input-fn` was not supplied, like this:\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :query-id\n        a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n\n  is the equivalent of using this\n  2nd variation and explicitly suppling a `signal-fn` which returns `app-db`:\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :query-id\n        (fn [_ _]  re-frame/app-db)   ;; <--- explicit signal-fn\n        a-computation-fn)             ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n\n  **Third variation** - syntax Sugar\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :a-b-sub\n        :<- [:a-sub]\n        :<- [:b-sub]\n        (fn [[a b] query-vec]    ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\n          {:a a :b b}))\n\n  This 3rd variation is just syntactic sugar for the 2nd.  Instead of providing an\n  `signals-fn` you provide one or more pairs of `:<-` and a subscription vector.\n\n  If you supply only one pair a singleton will be supplied to the computation function,\n  as if you had supplied a `signal-fn` returning only a single value:\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :a-sub\n        :<- [:a-sub]\n        (fn [a query-vec]      ;; only one pair, so 1st argument is a single value\n          ...))\n\n  For further understanding, read the tutorials, and look at the detailed comments in\n  /examples/todomvc/src/subs.cljs.\n\n  See also: `subscribe`\n  \"\n  {:api-docs/heading \"Subscriptions\"}\n  [query-id & args]\n  (apply subs/reg-sub (into [query-id] args)))\n\n(defn subscribe\n  \"Given a `query` vector, returns a Reagent `reaction` which will, over\n  time, reactively deliver a stream of values.

The duplicates check made after\n  'delete todo' event might be subtly different to that done after an\n  editing operation. Nice and efficient, but fiddly. A bug generator\n  approach.\n\n  So, instead, we create an `f` which recalculates ALL warnings from scratch\n  every time there is ANY change.

It will inspect all the todos, and\n  reset ALL FLAGS every time (overwriting what was there previously)\n  and fully recalculate the list of duplicates (displayed at the bottom?).\n\n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nathanmarz/status/879722740776939520\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/nathanmarz/status/879722740776939520</a>\n\n  By applying `f` in an `:enrich` interceptor, after every CRUD event,\n  we keep the handlers simple and yet we ensure this important step\n  (of getting warnings right) is not missed on any change.\n\n  We can test `f` easily - it is a pure function - independently of\n  any CRUD operation.\n\n  This brings huge simplicity at the expense of some re-computation\n  each time.

When a node of type `query-id` is needed,\n  the two functions can be used to create it.\n\n  The three arguments are:\n\n  - `query-id` - typically a namespaced keyword (later used in subscribe)\n  - optionally, an `input signals` function which returns the input data\n    flows required by this kind of node.\n  - a `computation function` which computes the value (output) of the\n    node (from the input data flows)\n\n  Later, during app execution, a call to `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 :blue])`,\n  will trigger the need for a new `:sub-id` Signal Graph node (matching the\n  query `[:sub-id 3 :blue]`). And, to create that node the two functions\n  associated with `:sub-id` will be looked up and used.\n\n  Just to be clear: calling `reg-sub` does not immediately create a node.\n  It only registers 'a mechanism' (the two functions) by which nodes\n  can be created later, when a node is bought into existence by the\n  use of `subscribe` in a `View Function`.\n\n  The `computation function` is expected to take two arguments:\n\n    - `input-values` - the values which flow into this node (how is it wierd into the graph?)\n    - `query-vector` - the vector given to `subscribe`\n\n  and it returns a computed value (which then becomes the output of the node)\n\n  When `computation function` is called, the 2nd `query-vector` argument will be that\n  vector supplied to the `subscribe`. So, if the call was `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 :blue])`,\n  then the `query-vector` supplied to the computaton function will be `[:sub-id 3 :blue]`.\n\n  The argument(s) supplied to `reg-sub` between `query-id` and the `computation-function`\n  can vary in 3 ways, but whatever is there defines the `input signals` part\n  of `the mechanism`, specifying what input values \"flow into\" the\n  `computation function` (as the 1st argument) when it is called.\n\n  So, `reg-sub` can be called in one of three ways, because there are three ways\n  to define the input signals part. But note, the 2nd method, in which a\n  `signals function` is explicitly supplied, is the most canonical and\n  instructive.

When a node of type `query-id` is needed,\n  the two functions can be used to create it.\n\n  The three arguments are:\n\n  - `query-id` - typically a namespaced keyword (later used in subscribe)\n  - optionally, an `input signals` function which returns the input data\n    flows required by this kind of node.\n  - a `computation function` which computes the value (output) of the\n    node (from the input data flows)\n\n  Later, during app execution, a call to `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 :blue])`,\n  will trigger the need for a new `:sub-id` Signal Graph node (matching the\n  query `[:sub-id 3 :blue]`). And, to create that node the two functions\n  associated with `:sub-id` will be looked up and used.\n\n  Just to be clear: calling `reg-sub` does not immediately create a node.\n  It only registers 'a mechanism' (the two functions) by which nodes\n  can be created later, when a node is bought into existence by the\n  use of `subscribe` in a `View Function`.\n\n  The `computation function` is expected to take two arguments:\n\n    - `input-values` - the values which flow into this node (how is it wierd into the graph?)\n    - `query-vector` - the vector given to `subscribe`\n\n  and it returns a computed value (which then becomes the output of the node)\n\n  When `computation function` is called, the 2nd `query-vector` argument will be that\n  vector supplied to the `subscribe`. So, if the call was `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 :blue])`,\n  then the `query-vector` supplied to the computaton function will be `[:sub-id 3 :blue]`.\n\n  The argument(s) supplied to `reg-sub` between `query-id` and the `computation-function`\n  can vary in 3 ways, but whatever is there defines the `input signals` part\n  of `the mechanism`, specifying what input values \"flow into\" the\n  `computation function` (as the 1st argument) when it is called.\n\n  So, `reg-sub` can be called in one of three ways, because there are three ways\n  to define the input signals part.
